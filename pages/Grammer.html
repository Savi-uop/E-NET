            <h1>Simple Present</h1>
            <br>

            <p>The simple present is a verb tense with two main uses. We use the simple present tense when an action is
              happening right now, or when it happens regularly (or unceasingly, which is why it’s sometimes called
              present indefinite). Depending on the person, the simple present tense is formed by using the root form or
              by adding ‑s or ‑es to the end.</p>

            <!-- Simple Past-->

            <h1>Simple Past</h1>
            <br>

            <p> The <b>simple past</b> is a verb tense that is used to talk about things that happened or existed before
              now. Imagine someone asks what your
              brother Amila did while he was in town last weekend. <br> <br>

            <div class="d-flex">
              <div class="d-inline-block">Example</div>
              <div class="d-inline-block">
                <p style="margin-left: 70px; color: rgb(233, 223, 136);"> Amila <b style="color:rgb(233, 223, 136);">entered</b> a
                  chess contest
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="d-flex">
              <div class="d-inline-block">Example</div>
              <div class="d-inline-block">
                <p style="margin-left: 70px; color: rgb(233, 223, 136);"> He <b style="color:rgb(233, 223, 136);">won</b> the silver
                  medal
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <br>

            <p>The simple past tense shows that you are talking about
              something that has already happened. Unlike the past continuous tense,
              which is used to talk about past events that happened over a period of time,
              the simple past tense emphasizes that the action is finished.
              <br><br>

            <div class="d-flex">
              <div class="d-inline-block">Example</div>
              <div class="d-inline-block">
                <p style="margin-left: 70px; color: rgb(233, 223, 136);"> Amila <b style="color:rgb(233, 223, 136);"> admired </b>
                  the way the light <b style="color:rgb(233, 223, 136);">glinted</b> off his silver medal
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <br>

            <p>You can also use the simple past to talk
              about a past state of being, such as the way someone felt
              about something. This is often expressed with the simple past tense of the verb
              to be and an adjective, noun, or prepositional phrase. <br> <br>

            <br>

            <h2>How to Formulate the Simple Past</h2>
            <br>

            <p>For regular verbs, add -ed to the root form of the verb
              (or just -d if the root form already ends in an e): <br> <br> Play→Played Type→Typed Listen→Listened
              Push→Pushed
              Love→Loved <br> <br> For irregular verbs, things get more complicated.
              The simple past tense of some irregular verbs looks exactly like the
              root form: <br> <br> Put→Put Cut→Cut Set→Set Cost→Cost
              Hit→Hit <br> <br>For other irregular verbs, including the verb to be,
              the simple past forms are more erratic: <br> <br> See→Saw Build→Built
              Go→Went Do→Did Rise→Rose Am/Is/Are→Was/Were <br> <br> The good news is
              that verbs in the simple past tense (except for the verb to be) don’t
              need to agree in number with their subjects. </p>
            <br> <br>

            <div class="d-flex">
              <div class="d-inline-block">Example</div>
              <div class="d-inline-block">
                <p style="margin-left: 70px; color: rgb(233, 223, 136);">Amila <b style="color:rgb(233, 223, 136);">polished </b>his
                  medal. The other winners <b style="color:rgb(233, 223, 136);">polished</b> their medals too.

            <br>

            <h2>How to Make the Simple Past Negative</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Fortunately, there is a formula for making simple past verbs negative, and it’s the same for both regular
              and irregular verbs (except for the verb to be). The formula is did not + [root form of verb].
              You can also use the contraction didn’t instead of did not.
            </p>
            <br>

            <div class="d-flex">
              <div class="d-inline-block">Example</div>
              <div class="d-inline-block">
                <p style="margin-left: 70px; color: rgb(233, 223, 136);"> Amila <b style="color:rgb(233, 223, 136);">did not brag</b>
                  too much about his chess skills.Amila’s girlfriend <b style="color:rgb(233, 223, 136);">didn’t see</b> the
                  contest.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>


            <br>
            <p> For the verb to be, you don’t need the auxiliary did. When the subject of the sentence is singular, use
              was not or wasn’t.
              When the subject is plural, use were not or weren’t.
            </p>

            <!-- Past Continuous -->

            <h1>Past Continuous</h1>
            <br> 
            <p> The past continuous tense, also known as the past progressive tense, refers to a continuing action or
              state that was happening at some point in the past. The past continuous tense is formed by combining the
              past tense of to be (i.e., was/were) with
              the verb’s present participle (-ing word).
              <br> <br>
              There are many situations in which this verb tense might be used in a sentence. For example, it is often
              used to describe
              conditions that existed in the past.

            <!-- Past Perfect-->

            <h1>Past Perfect</h1>

            <br> 

            <p>The <b>past perfect</b>, also called the pluperfect, is a verb tense used to talk about actions that were 
              completed before some point in the past.</p>
              <br><br>

              <div class="d-flex" >
                <div class="d-inline-block">Example</div>
                <div class="d-inline-block">
                 <p style="margin-left: 70px; color: rgb(233, 223, 136);"> We were shocked to discover that someone <b>had graffitied</b> “Tootles was here” on our front door. We were 
                 relieved that Tootles <b> had used</b> washable paint

                </div>
              </div>
              <br>

              <p>The past perfect tense is for talking about something that happened 
                before something else. Imagine waking up one morning and stepping outside
                 to grab the newspaper. On your way back in, you notice a mysterious message scrawled across your front door: Tootles was here. When you’re telling this story to your friends later, how would you 
                describe this moment? You might say something like:
              </p>
              <br><br>

              <div class="d-flex" >
                <div class="d-inline-block">Example</div>
                <div class="d-inline-block">
                  <p style="margin-left: 70px; color: rgb(233, 223, 136);"> I turned back to the house and saw that some someone named Tootles <b> had defaced</b> my front door!
                </p> 
                </div>
              </div>
              <br>

                <p>In addition to feeling indignant on your behalf, your friends will also be 
                  able to understand that Tootles graffitied the door at some point in the past
                   before the moment this morning when you saw his handiwork, because you used the <b> past 
                  perfect</b> tense to describe the misdeed.
                </p>b
                <br>

                <h2>The Past Perfect Formula</h2>

                <br><br>

                <p>The formula for the past perfect tense is <b> had + [past participle].</b> It doesn’t
                 matter if the subject is singular or plural; the formula doesn’t change.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2>When to Use the Past Perfect</h2>
                <br><br>

                <p>So what’s the difference between past perfect and simple past? When you’re talking about some point in the past and want to reference an event that happened even earlier, using the past perfect allows you to convey the sequence of the events. It’s also clearer and more specific. 
                  Consider the difference between these two sentences
                </p>
                <br><br>

                <div class="d-flex" >
                  <div class="d-inline-block">Example</div>
                  <div class="d-inline-block">
                    <p style="margin-left: 70px; color: rgb(233, 223, 136);"> We were relieved that Tootles <b>used </b>  washable paint. We were relieved that Tootles <b> had used</b> washable paint.
                  </p> 
                  </div>
                </div>
                <br>

                <p>It’s a subtle difference, but the first sentence doesn’t tie Tootles’s act of using washable paint to any particular moment in time; readers might interpret it as “We were relieved that Tootles was in the habit of using washable paint.” In the second sentence, the past perfect makes it 
                  clear that you’re talking about a specific instance of using washable paint. <br> <br> Another time to use the past perfect is when you are expressing a condition 
                  and a result:
                </p>
                <br><br>

                <div class="d-flex" >
                  <div class="d-inline-block">Example</div>
                  <div class="d-inline-block">
                    <p style="margin-left: 70px; color: rgb(233, 223, 136);"> If I <b> had woken up</b> earlier this morning, I would have caught Tootles red-handed.
                  </p> 
                  </div>
                </div>
                <br>

                <p>The past perfect is used in the part of the sentence that explains the 
                  condition (the if-clause). <br><br>
                  Most often, the reason to write a verb in the past perfect tense is to show that it happened before other actions in the same sentence that are described by verbs in the simple past tense. Writing an entire paragraph with every 
                  verb in the past perfect tense is unusual
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2>When Not to Use the Past Perfect</h2>
                <br><br>

                <p>Don’t use the past perfect when you’re not trying to convey some sequence of events. 
                  If your friends asked what you did after you discovered the graffiti, 
                  they would be confused if you said:
                </p>
                <br><br>

                <div class="d-flex" >
                  <div class="d-inline-block">Example</div>
                  <div class="d-inline-block">
                    <p style="margin-left: 70px; color: rgb(233, 223, 136);"> I <b> had cleaned</b> it off the door.
                  </p> 
                  </div>
                </div>

                <p>They’d likely be wondering what happened next because using the past perfect implies that your action of cleaning the door occurred before something else happened, but you don’t say what that something else is. The “something else” doesn’t always have to be explicitly mentioned, but context needs to make it clear. In this case there’s no context, 
                  so the past perfect doesn’t make sense.

            <h1>Past Perfect Continuous</h1>
            <br>
            
            <p>The past perfect continuous tense (also known as the past perfect progressive tense) shows that an action that started in the past continued up until another time in the past. 
              The past perfect continuous tense is 
              constructed using <b> been + the verb’s present participle (root + -ing).</b>
              <br> <br>
              Unlike the present perfect continuous, which indicates an action that began in the past 
              and continued up to the present, the past perfect continuous is a verb tense that indicates 
              something that began in the past, 
              continued in the past, and also ended at a defined point in the past.
