            <p style="color: white;">A noun is a word that names something, such as a person, place, thing, or idea. In a sentence, 
              nouns can play the role of subject, direct object, indirect object, subject complement, object 
              complement, appositive, or adjective. Often noun will be the name for somethig we can touch. 
              But sometimes a noun will be a name for something we can not touch. Everything is represented 
              by a word that lets us talk about it.

                  Proper noun can also occur in secondary application, for example modifying nouns and in the role of common 
                  nouns. A distinction is normally made in current lingistics between proper nouns and proper names. Words
                  derived from proper names are sometimes called proper adjectives. Not every noune or noun phrase that refers 
                  to a unique entity is a proper name.

              <p style="color: white;">
                A noun is a word that names a person, animal, place, thing, or idea. All nouns can be further classified as 
                a proper or common noun. Common nouns are words used to name general items rather than specific ones. Go into 
                your living room. What do you see? A lamp, chair, couch, TV, window, painting, pillow, candle – all of these 
                items are named using common nouns.Common nouns are everywhere, and you use them all the time, even if you don’t 
                realize it. Wherever you go, you’ll find at least one common noun. Street, closet, bathroom, school, mall, gas 
                station, living room; all of these places are things, and thus they are common nouns.

              <p style="color: white;">
                We use common nouns to denote a class of objects or a concept. Consider the word star, as in the stars we see in 
                the sky. Star is used as a common noun, used to denote the class of objects that we view in the night sky, i.e. 
                the luminescent bodies that are spread across the universe, twinkling overhead. The Sun, however, is a proper noun, 
                used to describe the specific star that is at the center of our solar system.<br><br>
                <strong>example :-</strong> when talking about your mother, mother is a common noun
                <ul style="color: white;">
                  <li>My mother is an actress.</li>

                When we look at the two main types of noun – proper and common – we can differentiate between the two by saying that a 
                proper noun is a general way of classifying something, and a proper noun is a specific way of classifying something, So, 
                for example, the word dog is a common noun; but if your dog was called Fido, the word Fido is a proper noun:
                <ul style="color: white;">
                  <li><strong>dog</strong> = common noun</li>
                  <li><strong>dog's name</strong> = proper noun</li>

                Material noun is the name given to the material, substance or things made up of alloy. It refers to the type of substance
                instead of individual particles of the substance. Material nouns are not Countable means we can not count them because they
                are in the form of liquid, semi liquid or solid. Sometimes we can not make the plural form of material noun.

                    Compound nouns are words for people, animals, places, things or ideas, made up of two or more words. Most Compound
                    nouns are made with nouns that have been modified by adjectives or other nouns. Some times one word like toothpaste, 
                    haircut, bathroom etc. These are often refered to as closed or solid compound nouns.

                    (like counting all the people in the world, for example). Countable nouns can be used with articles such as a/an 
                    and the or quantifiers such as a few and many. Look at the sentence below and pay particular attention to the 
                    countable noun.<br><br>

                    Uncountable nouns are nouns that come in a state or quantity that is impossible to count; liquids are uncountable, 
                    as are things that act like liquids (sand, air). Abstract ideas like creativity or courage are also uncountable. 
                    Uncountable nouns are always considered to be singular, and can stand alone or be used with some, any, a little, and much. 
                    See the examples below for reference.<br><br>

                    A Collective noun is a word or phrase that refers to agroup of people or thing as one entity. One common error that arises 
                    from using Collective noun is subject-verb disagreement. A Collective noun always describes a plurality of one kind or another. 
                    Normaly we are use collective nouns as single. the past tense affords a wonderful respite from this subject-verb agreement 
                    problem. We get this break because in the past tense, first-person and third person verb forms are the same. 
                    <br><br>

                    Concrete nouns are the nouns that you can physically see and touch. This is generally easy to understand. If you look around
                    ypur Wherever you are, chances are that you will see hundreds of concreate nouns. They include common one like clothes or 
                    windows, but also more rare ones like fossil or toothpick. 
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>example :-</strong> The <strong>sunset</strong> unfurled ribbons of red purple and gold acress the key.

                    An abstract noun is a noun that refers to an intangible concept such as an emotion, a feeling, a quality, or an idea. In other 
                    words, an abstract noun does not refer to a physical object. It is sometimes helpful to think of an abstract noun as a word 
                    that names something that you cannot see, hear, touch, smell, or taste (i.e., something you cannot perceive with one of your 
                    five senses). 
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>example :-</strong> Love is a kind of irresistible <strong>desire</strong>. It is hard to define.

            <h5 style="color: turquoise;">What are adjectives?</h5>
            <p>Adjectives are an important part of speech. Adjectives are used to describe nouns. They are words that
              describe or modify another person, thing, place, or idea in the sentence. They can also describe pronouns,
              which are words that stand in for nouns (click on the link for the lesson on nouns). Adjectives most of
              the time come before the word, they are used to describe nouns.</p>

            <p>Adjectives come in front of nouns that they are describing, but not always. In the sentence below, the
              adjectives in bold</p>

              <strong>murky</strong> and <strong>pond</strong> describe water.</p>

            <h5 style="color: silver;"><u>Comparative Adjectives</u></h5>
            <p>When we talk about two things, we can "compare" them. We can see if they are the same or different.
              Perhaps they are the same in some ways and different in other ways. We can use comparative adjectives to
              describe the differences.</p>

            <p style="color:rgb(233, 14, 14);">We use comparative adjectives when talking about two things (not three or
              more things).</p>

              <p>As with comparative adjectives, there are two ways to form a <b>superlative adjective:</b> </p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>short</b> adjectives: add <b>"-est"</b></li>
                <li><b>long</b> adjectives: use <b>"most"</b></li>
              </ul>

              <p>also usually add 'the' at the beginning.</p>

              <p>Most adjectives are <b>"common adjectives"</b>. They describe people, places and things, for example:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>tall man, big dog, noisy baby</li>

                <li>red car, hot weather, expensive watch</li>

                <div class="row gx-2 text-dark">
                  <div class="p-3 bg-light">
                    <p>
                      <b>Proper nouns</b> are nouns that refer to unique places, people or organizations. The word
                      "country" is a common noun because there are many countries. The word "Thailand" is a proper noun
                      because there is only one Thailand and Thailand is its name. Just like you. You are unique and you
                      have a name. Your name is a proper noun and in English we spell it with a capital letter at the
                      start (example Elizabeth, Donald).
                    </p>
                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>
              <br>
              <p><b>"Proper adjectives"</b> also describe people, places and things, but they are based on names and
                therefore need to be capitalized, like the names. For example, Spain is the name of a country and starts
                with a capital letter. The adjective based on Spain (<b>Spanish</b>) must also start with a capital
                letter. Mars is the name of a planet and starts with a capital letter. The adjective based on Mars
                (<b>Martian</b>) must also start with a capital letter. Shakespeare was the name of a famous writer and
                starts with a capital letter. The adjective based on Shakespeare (Shakespearean) must also start with a
                capital letter.</p>

              <p>Proper adjectives are mostly of two types: </p>
              <ol>
                <li><b>those that come from names of places—countries, continents, regions, cities</b>
                  <p>Eg : Jumbo was a famous <b style="color: blue;">African</b> elephant.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>those that come from names of people—usually famous people, mostly historical, some modern</b>
                  <p>This is the most famous of the <b style="color: blue;">Buddhist</b> temples here.</p>
                </li>

              <br>
              <h6 style="color: aqua;">Prefixes with Proper Adjectives</h6>
              <p>Normally, a prefix attached to a proper adjective should not be capitalized. Look at these examples:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li><b>pre-Christian</b>
                  <p>Paganism was one of many <b>pre-Christian</b> religions.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>pan-European</b>
                  <p>The search for a <b>pan-European</b> identity started well before 1900.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>post-Thatcherite</b>
                  <p>Did wages go up in <b>post-Thatcherite</b> Britain?</p>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Note that the prefix should not be capitalized, unless it starts the sentence:
                  <b>anti-Western</b>
                  <p> Anti-Western sentiment was an inevitable consequence.</p>
                </li>

                <li>If the prefix itself is formed from a proper noun, then the prefix should of course by capitalized.
                  In the following example, Austro- comes from the proper noun Austria and Hungarian comes from the
                  proper noun Hungary.
                  <b>Austro-Hungarian</b>
                  <p> The assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne led directly to the First World War.
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  In the next example, the prefix Afro- comes from the proper noun Africa, and Caribbean is the proper
                  adjective from the proper noun Caribbean:
                  <b>Afro-Caribbean</b>
                  <p> He loves Afro-Caribbean music.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <br>
              <h6 style="color: aqua;">Hyphenation with Proper Adjectives</h6>

              <p>The same logic applies with suffixes and other hyphenated forms—capitalize only the word or words
                derived from a proper noun:</p>
              <b>English-speaking</b>
              <p> Eg : She asked for an English-speaking guide to show her around.</p>

              <br>
              <h6 style="color: aqua;">When Proper Adjectives Lose their Connection</h6>
              <p>Sometimes proper adjectives lose their connection with the proper noun that gave them the right to be
                capitalized, for example:</p>
              Eg : gargantuan, titanic, caesarian, draconian, herculean, spartan

                  Pronouns are a part of speech in English, and, like all parts of speech, they serve a purpose. Verbs, for example, 
                  tell you what someone is doing. Pronouns are words that you can substitute for another noun (or a name) when the 
                  context has already made it clear whom or what you’re talking about. In English, when you’re talking about an individual 
                  person, you’ll most often be using a third-person pronoun. The most common third-person pronouns for individuals are she 
                  and he. Some people use the pronoun they instead of she or he, and some use other pronouns like ze or ey. Some use different 
                  sets of pronouns in different contexts. And there are some who use no pronouns at all, and instead use their name in all cases.
                  Pronouns have evolved to represent people’s identities beyond the gender binary of masculine (he/him) and feminine (she/her). 
                  The most well-known of these more inclusive, nonbinary pronouns is the singular they/them; there are many others in use.

                Indefinite pronouns do not refer to a specific person, place, or thing. In English, there is a particular group of 
                indefinite pronouns formed with a quantifier or distributive preceeded by any, some, every and no.

                  A personal pronoun is a short word we use as a simple substitute for the proper name of a person. Each of the English 
                  personal pronouns shows us the grammatical person, gender, number, and case of the noun it replaces. I, you, he, she, 
                  it, we they, me, him, her, us, and them are all personal pronouns. Personal pronouns are the stunt doubles of grammar; 
                  they stand in for the people (and perhaps animals) who star in our sentences. They allow us to speak and write with 
                  economy because they enable us to avoid repeating cumbersome proper nouns all the live-long day.

                  A demonstrative pronoun is a pronoun that is used to point to something specific within a sentence. These pronouns can indicate 
                  items in space or time, and they can be either singular or plural. When used to represent a thing or things, demonstrative 
                  pronouns can be either near or far in distance or time
                    <ul style="color: white;">
                        <li>Near in time or distance: this, these</li>
                        <li>Far in time or distance: that, those</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="color: white;">Because there are only a few demonstrative pronouns in the English language, there are just three simple rules for using them 
                    correctly. Remember them and you will have no difficulty using these surprisingly interesting parts of speech.</p>
                    <ul style="color: white;">
                        <li>Demonstrative pronouns always identify nouns, whether those nouns are named specifically or not. For example: “I can’t 
                            believe this.” We have no idea what “this” is, but it’s definitely something the writer cannot believe. It exists, even 
                            though we don’t know what it is.
                        </li>
                        <li>Demonstrative pronouns are usually used to describe animals, places, or things, however they can be used to describe 
                            people when the person is identified, i.e., This sounds like Mary singing.

                  A relative pronoun is a word that introduces a dependent (or relative) clause and connects it to an independent clause. A clause 
                  beginning with a relative pronoun is poised to answer questions such as <i>Which one? How many?</i> or <i>What kind?  Who, whom, what, which,</i> 
                  and that are all relative pronouns.Relative clauses are also sometimes referred to as adjective clauses, because they identify or 
                  give us additional information about the subject of the independent clause they relate to. Like adjectives, these clauses in some 
                  way describe that subject. Relative pronouns, like conjunctions, are words that join clauses in this case, a relative clause to 
                  its main clause. The type of relative pronoun used depends on what kind of noun is being described.

                    of some type, with both receiving the benefits or consequences of that action simultaneously. Any time something is done or given 
                    in return, reciprocal pronouns are used. The same is true any time mutual action is expressed. There are only two reciprocal 
                    pronouns. Both of them allow you to make sentences simpler. They are especially useful when you need to express the same general 
                    idea more than once.

                <p style="color: white;">An intensive pronoun is almost identical to a reflexive pronoun, but their functions differ. Intensive pronouns are used to add
                    emphasis to the subject or antecedent of the sentence. You’ll usually find the intensive pronoun right after the noun or pronoun
                    it’s modifying, but not necessarily.

            <h1 style="color: yellowgreen;">Preposition</h1>
            <h5 style="color: turquoise;">What is a Preposition?</h5>
            <p>Prepositions are very common words. Prepositions link a word to another part of the sentence and tell us
              what the relationship is, for example in space or time.</p>

            <div class="container">
              <div class="row g-2">
                <div class="p-3 bg-light">
                  <p class="text-dark">preposition (noun): a part-of-speech usually coming <b>BEFORE</b> a noun phrase
                    and connecting it to another part of the sentence</p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>

            <br>
            <p>The name preposition (pre + position) means "place BEFORE". A <b style="color: maroon;">preposition</b>
              typically comes BEFORE <b>another word</b>—usually a noun phrase. It tells us about the relationship
              between the noun phrase and another part of the sentence. <br> Some very common prepositions are: <br> <b
                style="color: rgb(0, 205, 188);">in, of, on, for, with, at, by</b></p>

            <p>Look at these example sentences: </p>

            <ul>
              <li>The book is <b style="color: maroon;">on</b> <b style="color: rgb(0, 205, 188);"> the round table</b>.
                (relationship in space)</li>
              <li>We will meet <b style="color: maroon;">in</b> <b style="color: rgb(0, 205, 188);">November</b>.
                (relationship in time)</li>
              <li>I sent the information <b style="color: maroon;">by</b> <b style="color: rgb(0, 205, 188);">email</b>.
                (relationship of method)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Several other relationships are expressed by prepositions. In addition, more metaphorical ideas can be
              expressed such as: <i>in love, beyond doubt, under investigation</i></p>

            <p>If a preposition does not come BEFORE another word, it is still closely linked to another word:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><b style="color: rgb(0, 205, 188);">Who</b> did you talk <b style="color: maroon;">to</b> ?</li>
              <li><b style="color: maroon;">To</b> <b style="color: rgb(0, 205, 188);"> whom</b> did you talk?</li>
              <li>I talked <b style="color: maroon;">to</b> <b style="color: rgb(0, 205, 188);">Jane</b>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5 style="color: turquoise;">Form</h5>
            <p>Prepositions have no particular form. The majority of prepositions are single words, but some are two- or
              three-word phrases: </p>

            <ul>
              <li>one-word prepositions (before, into, on) </li>
              <li>complex prepositions (according to, but for, in spite of)</li>
            </ul>

            <h5 style="color: turquoise;">A Simple Preposition Rule</h5>

            <p>There is one very simple rule about prepositions. And, unlike most rules, this rule has no exceptions.
            </p>

            <p> <b style="color: red;">Rule</b>: A preposition is followed by a "noun". It is never followed by a verb.
              <br> By "noun" we include:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>noun (dog, money, love)</li>
              <li>proper noun (name) (Bangkok, Mary)</li>
              <li>pronoun (you, him, us)</li>
              <li>noun group (my first job)</li>
              <li>gerund (swimming)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A preposition cannot be followed by a verb. If we want to follow a preposition by a verb, we must use the
              "-ing" form which is really a gerund or verb in noun form.</p>

            <div class="container">
              <div class="row g-2">
                <div class=" alert-warning" role="alert">
                  <p>In the following sentences, why is the preposition "to" followed by a verb? That should be
                    impossible, according to the rule that you have just read.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>I would like to go now.</li>
                    <li> She used to smoke.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p style="color: red;">The answer is that in "I would like to go now" and "She used to smoke", the
                    word "to" is not a preposition. It is part of the infinitive ("to go", "to smoke").</p>

              <h5 id="coConjun">Correlative conjunctions</h5>
              <p>Correlative Conjunctions are pairs of words that work together to connect two parts of a sentence that hold an equal value, or correlate with one another. <br>
                <span class="changeExample">Example : either .. or , neither .. nor, both .. and , not only .. but also  </span>
                <br>
                <ol>
                  <li>Either…Or: This correlative conjunction pair is used to join to positive items or options.
                  <br> <b>Example:</b> We can either eat at home or go to the restaurant nearby.</li>
                  <li>Both… And: This correlative conjunction pair is used to emphasise the true facts in a given sentence. 
                  <br> <b>Example:</b>They have both a swimming pool and a jacuzzi in their backyard.</li>
                  <li>Neither…Nor: This pair of correlative conjunction is used to join negative options or items.
                  <br><b>Example:</b>Neither did her sister nor her best friend showed up at the event.</li>
                  <li>Not only…But also: This correlative conjunction pair is similar to using ‘and’.<br><b>Example:</b>Not only is he a linguist but also a pianist.</li>
                </ol>

              </p>
